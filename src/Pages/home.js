                                <p>My name is Paul Nguyen and I build things on the internet.

As it says above, I'm based out of Chicago. I'm a young passionate developer using his knowledge in the arts and applying it to web development. Creating websites was a newfound passion that I didn't even know I was going to enjoy, but nonetheless I absolutely love it.</p>
